# LiberTi*k*Z

This LaTeX package aims to adjust the style of Ti*k*Z arrows to better suit the math font Libertinus Math.

The package can be used by including the package file `libertikz.sty` into the root directory of your project and then loading the package into your project via `\usepackage{libertikz}` or `\RequirePackage{libertikz}`.
It is probably sensible to load `tikz` (resp. `tikzcd`) before `libertikz`.

This progress is a work in progress.
A compiled version of the currend status is available at [https://ciox.gitlab.io/libertikz/libertikz-test.pdf][1].
